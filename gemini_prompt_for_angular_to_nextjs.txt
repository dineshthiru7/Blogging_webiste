I’m converting Angular service files to Next.js (React). These services may include auth logic, configuration loading, environment setup, or API communication.

In Angular, services use constructors, dependency injection, and environment files to initialize values (like base URLs, tokens, or shared state) once and reuse them across the app.

In Next.js, I want to:
	•	Avoid using classes or constructors
	•	Use function-based or module-based code
	•	Initialize config or setup logic once and reuse it
	•	Follow best practices with environment variables, axios/fetch for HTTP, and React state where needed
	•	Replace Angular dependency injection with reusable imports or singleton patterns

Please convert the Angular service into idiomatic Next.js code that supports these goals and works cleanly in a modern React application.


✅ FINAL GEMINI 1.5 PRO PROMPT  
⚙️ Purpose: Convert Angular Service to Modern Next.js (v13/14) using TypeScript and React Best Practices

You are an expert in full-stack TypeScript development, specializing in converting Angular codebases into modern Next.js (v13/v14+) using React, TypeScript, and modular architecture.

I need you to accurately transform an Angular service into its equivalent implementation in a modern Next.js app.

🧾 INPUT FORMAT:

Service File Name: [Insert Angular service file name here]

Angular Service Code:
```ts
// Paste the original Angular service code here
```

---

✅ REQUIREMENTS FOR CONVERSION:

1. Rewrite the Angular service as a modular, reusable function, class, or hook in TypeScript, targeting Next.js 13+ (preferably App Router).

2. Replace:
   - HttpClient with fetch or Axios
   - Observable-based calls with async/await or React Query (useQuery, useMutation)
   - Dependency injection (constructor(private service: ...)) with explicit imports, React Context, or custom hooks
   - Any Angular lifecycle logic (ngOnInit) with appropriate React useEffect patterns

3. Ensure:
   - All API URLs are dynamic via process.env (like process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL)
   - Token/auth-based logic is handled using a React Context or passed explicitly
   - File naming follows camelCase or kebab-case, and folders follow Next.js conventions (services/, hooks/, context/)

4. If route guards or interceptors are used, suggest alternatives using:
   - middleware.ts
   - custom Axios wrappers or headers
   - React-based route protection (auth context)

📦 OUTPUT FORMAT:

```ts
// Converted Next.js service (TypeScript)
export async function yourConvertedMethod(...) {
  // implementation
}
```

(Optional) If React Context or hook is required:
```ts
// Example: useUser.ts or useAuth.ts
export function useUser() {
  // logic using useQuery or useEffect
}
```

📝 Also include: 
- A short summary of changes or assumptions
- Suggest any required env variables or helper files (e.g., apiClient.ts, auth.ts)

---

🔁 Please ensure the output is:
- Clean
- Type-safe
- Idiomatic to modern React/Next.js
- Ready for real production usage

DO NOT return pseudocode — I want actual, compilable code.
